Timestamps are used to determine the order of events. They are usually written in ISO 8601 format, such as:

2025-06-01T16:56:34Z

Hereâ€™s how to compare timestamps:

- The year comes first. A timestamp in 2025 is newer than one in 2024.
- Next is the month. "06" (June) is later than "05" (May).
- Then comes the day. "02" is later than "01".
- Then the hour (24-hour format), then minutes, then seconds.
- "Z" means the time is in UTC.

### Example:

2025-06-01T16:56:33Z is earlier than 2025-06-01T16:56:34Z.

Therefore, when comparing runs:
- Sort by year, then month, day, hour, minute, second.
- The latest run is the one with the largest timestamp.
